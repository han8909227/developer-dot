Avalara’s crack team of engineers receives dozens of questions every week from developers using our APIs, SDKs and documentation, and we want to answer as many as we can.

To that end, we’re excited to announce a new twice-weekly, 30-minute series of webinars that we’re calling Office Hours with AvaTax. This is your opportunity to ask our expert team of engineers and developers any questions that may be top of your mind about the AvaTax platform in an open Q&A format.

The new Office Hours with AvaTax series kicks off at 10 a.m. PT on Tuesday, Jan. 2 and at 10 a.m. PT on Thursday, Jan. 4. The webinar series is scheduled to run at 10 a.m. PT every Tuesday and Thursday from there on out.

Have a question about how to get started using the AvaTax API? Want to know what SDKs are available and in what programming languages? Need some help calculating tax offline? Want some expert assistance customizing your transactions? Avalara’s team of engineers can answer all these questions and more – we are eager to help make the process of building accurate tax calculation solutions quick and easy for you.
