You're invited to join Avalara's API development team at CRUSH DC 2018 - the premier annual tax conference for Avalara's customers and partners, and anyone interested in learning about tax compliance.  You'll get to meet and work with Ted Spence, Director of the AvaTax API team; Mark Wilhelm, Director of Avalara's Partner Launch team, and many other key people from Avalara's developer relations organization.

The conference contains two days full of training sessions where you'll learn all about tax compliance and the AvaTax API.
