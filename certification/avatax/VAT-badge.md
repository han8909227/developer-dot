      <h3>Additional Requirements - Customer Record Integration</h3>
        <h5>Business identification No. - <em>Required</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">Also known as VAT Registration ID – This data element should be found directly on the transaction (sales order, sales invoice) header.  Some applications may not carry that information onto the transaction itself, and the connector may have to pull directly from the customer record.</p>
            
        <h5>Is Seller Importer of Record  - <em>Required</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">Is the merchant/seller the importer of record for this transaction.</p>
