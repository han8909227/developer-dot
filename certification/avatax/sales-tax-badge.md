        <h5>AvaTax Test Connect Button - <em>Required</em></h5>
             <p class="badgerequirement">Test the connection to the AvaTax service and verify the AvaTax credentials. This is an important element to allow for successful troubleshooting of the AvaTax Service.</p>
    
        
        <h5>Control - Disable Document Recording - <em>Required</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">In order for this connector to be used in conjunction with other integrations to AvaTax, the user must be able to control which connector is used for recording documents to AvaTax. From a technical standpoint, simply use <code>DocType: 'SalesOrder'</code> on all calls and suppress any non-getTax calls (i.e. cancelTax, postTax).</p>
            <p class="badgerequirement"><small>Note: Other documentation may refer to Document Committing, this is interchangeable with Document Recording</small></p>
            
        <h5>Disable AvaTax Option - <em>Required</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">The user must have an option to turn on or off the AvaTax Calculation service independent of any other Avalara product or service.</p>
            
        <h5>Enable client side logging - <em>Required</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">Enables detailed AvaTax transaction logging within the application including capture of round-trip processing time. We need the complete request/response for each call made to Avalara services. It does not need to run all the time as we understand the database will grow unnecessarily large – you are free to only log the last week, 30 days, custom, or have a control for the next N hours, etc. The spirit of the requirement is to assist customers and support in troubleshooting exercises, so it needs to be retrievable by an end user (or an administrator). It should be specifically Avalara service calls.</p>
            
        <h5>Request time out definition - <em>Suggested</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">Define AvaTax request time out length, AvaTax best practices prescribes default setting of 300 ms.</p>

            <p class="badgerequirement">Enable the tax inclusive flag in the GetTax Request.</p>

        <h5>Enable AvaTax UPC - <em>Suggested</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">When set to true: pass in UPC code into the Avalara ItemCode on the line level of the requests to our service. When UPC is unavailable, default to ItemCode.When set to false: use the default ItemCode mapping. See Product Master Management for more details.</p>
            <p class="badgerequirement"><small>NOTE: Alternately, UPC can be enabled on the item level.</small></p>

        <h5>User Implementation Guide - <em>Required</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">The User Implementation Guide should contain screenshots and information allowing the end user to configure for AvaTax including where the company code is entered, where the credentials are entered and where tax codes can be mapped within the application. <a href="https://help.avalara.com/Directory/AvaTax_Partner_Documentation_Help" target="_blank">Click Here</a> for a user guide template.</p>

        <h5>Entity/Use Code - <em>Required</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">This is a group of codes that indicate the type of exemption.  See the standard codes, but be aware that users are able to create custom codes as well. It is best to manage this value in your application’s Customer record and pass it to AvaTax as CustomerUsageType at either the document or line level, whichever is applicable.</p>
            
        <h5>Exemption Number - <em>Suggested</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">Customer record field populating exemption number in an AvaTax transaction. This is used for tracking those customers who have tax exempt transactions.</p>

Example: “UPC:1234567890000”. by formatting the value with “UPC:” identifier, our engine can pick up the UPC code, and the user can avoid mapping a tax code for that item. If no UPC data is available still default to the regular ItemCode mapping.</p>
            <p class="badgerequirement"><small>NOTE:  The UPC functionality is a premium upgrade to the Avalara AvaTax subscription providing taxability decision (taxable vs. non-taxable) without requiring an Avalara Tax Code assignment.</small></p>
