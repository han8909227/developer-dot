Now that you’ve made it through <a class="dev-guide-link" href="/avatax/dev-guide/getting-started-with-avatax/">Chapter 1 - Getting Started with AvaTax</a>, we’re going to get into the real meat and potatoes of what AvaTax does – calculating tax on transactions. 

This chapter will help you understand all the information you need to gather in order to produce accurate, fast, reliable tax calculations.  At its core, AvaTax is designed to help you calculate taxes on a sales transaction between two parties; all the parameters in the API call help you ensure your tax calculation is correct.  We'll show you how to interpret the results you receive back from the API, and to display them to your customer.

By the end of this chapter, you will have learned how to create a basic transaction.  Don’t worry, though – we’ll go over some more complicated scenarios in <a class="dev-guide-link" href="/avatax/dev-guide/customizing-transaction/">Chapter 3 - Customizing Your Transaction</a>.
