<h2>The Tax Content API Response</h2>

Avalara's Tax Content API provides businesses with the content required to calculate tax locally in a disconnected environment. The Content API response includes tax jurisdiction, tax rate, and product/service taxability information for each Tax Code and storefront Location configured in your AvaTax account.
To begin, let's take a look at the fields included in a Tax Content API response.

Here are the details for each field included in a Tax Content API response:

<h2>Consuming Tax Content</h2>

In order to calculate tax locally, you'll need to implement logic in your native POS application that can correctly interpret and calculate tax using the data from the Tax Content API. The next sections will review common uses cases for leveraging the Tax Content API results to calculate tax locally.

<h3>Thresholds & Caps</h3>

This section is about interpreting Cap & Threshold values included in Tax Content API results. By the end of this section, you will learn the following

<ul class="dev-guide-list">
  <li>How to interpret Threshold and Cap values</li>
  <li>How to interpret TaxRule Options associated with Cap and Threshold values</li>
</ul>

  }
]
</pre>
<br/>

As noted in Chapter 1, the Threshold field applies a threshold to the taxable amount. Amounts up to and including the threshold are non-taxable. Amounts over the threshold are taxable. The tax rate included in the API response applies to the taxable amount. In this example, the Threshold value is $250, meaning the products you associate with Tax Code PC040100 for this Location would not become taxable until they were sold for more than $250.

Let's look at a transaction where the LineAmount is $200.00

<div class="mobile-table">
	<table class="styled-table">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>JurisdictionName</th>
				<th>LineAmount</th>
				<th>Tax Base</th>
        <th>Rate</th>
        <th>Tax</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>RHODE ISLAND</td>
        <td>$200.00</td>
        <td>$0.00</td>
        <td>0.07</td>
        <td>$0.00</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<br/>

No tax should be calculated because the LineAmount is below the $250.00 threshold state in the Tax Content API results.

Now, let's look at a transaction where the LineAmount is $300.00

<div class="mobile-table">
	<table class="styled-table">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>JurisdictionName</th>
				<th>LineAmount</th>
				<th>Tax Base</th>
        <th>Rate</th>
        <th>Tax</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>RHODE ISLAND</td>
        <td>$300.00</td>
        <td>$50.00</td>
        <td>0.07</td>
        <td>$3.50</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<br/>

Tax was calculated against $50.00 of the LineAmount because that is the amount that exceeded the $250.00 threshold stated in the Tax Content API results.

<h4>Thresholds and TaxAll TaxRuleOption</h4>

<h5>Assertions</h5>

Location Address: 50 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118<br/>
Tax Code(s): PC040100

<h5>Expected API Result</h5>

Assuming nexus is configured for the state of New York, the Tax Content API will produce the following response for the asserted Address and Tax Code. The Tax Content API will return three records that share a single ScenarioId. These results represent the taxing jurisdictions and their associated tax rules and rates that are applicable to the Location and TaxCode specified in the results. These results should be used in conjunction with one another for the specified LocationCode and TaxCode.

]
</pre>
<br/>

In this example, the Threshold value is $110 for all three records meaning the products associated with PC040100 for this LocationCode would not become taxable until they were sold for $110.00 or more. Additionally, TaxRuleOptions field includes the "TaxAll" value. With TaxAll, the entire LineAmount becomes taxable once the threshold is met. This is different from the Rhode Island example in the previous section where the amount up to and including the Threshold was bucketed as exempt, while any amount over the Threshold was bucketed as taxable.

Let's look at a transaction where the LineAmount is $100.00

<div class="mobile-table">
	<table class="styled-table">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>JurisdictionName</th>
				<th>LineAmount</th>
				<th>Tax Base</th>

        <td>$0.00</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<br/>

No tax was calculated because the LineAmount was below the $110.00 threshold state in the Tax Content API results.

Now, let's look at a transaction where the LineAmount is $125.

<div class="mobile-table">
	<table class="styled-table">

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>NEW YORK CITY</td>

        <td>$125.00</td>
        <td>0.045</td>
        <td>$5.63</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>METROPOLITAN COMMUTER TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT</td>
        <td>$125.00</td>
        <td>$125.00</td>
        <td>0.00375</td>
        <td>$0.47</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<br/>

Tax was calculated against the entire LineAmount because the LineAmount exceeded the Threshold value and the TaxAll TaxRuleOption was applicable.

<h4>Caps</h4>

<h5>Assertions</h5>

Location Address: 201 Criser Hall, Gainsville, FL 32611<br/>

In this example, the Cap value is Null for the State record and is $5,000 for the County record. In this scenario, the State rate applies to the entire LineAmount, while the County rate only applies to the first $5,000 of the LineAmount, "capping" the tax amount.

Let's look at a transaction where the LineAmount is $4,500.

<div class="mobile-table">

        <td>$22.50</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<br/>

Tax was calculated on the full LineAmount for the State because there was no Cap stated in the Tax Content API results.

Tax was calculated on the full LimeAmount for the County because the LineAmount was below the $5,000 Cap stated in the Tax Content API results.

Now, let's look at a transaction where the LineAmount is $7,000.

<div class="mobile-table">
	<table class="styled-table">

</div>
<br/>

Tax was again calculated on the full LineAmount for the State because there was no Cap stated in the Tax Content API results.

Tax was only calculated on the first $5,000 for the county because the LineAmount exceeded the $5,000 Cap stated in the Tax Content API results.  

<h3>Sales Tax Holidays</h3>

Many states offer annual sales tax holidays, providing a reduction or elimination of sales tax on specific categories of products for a short period of time. This section is about interpreting Tax Content API results for Sales Tax Holidays. By the end of this section, you will learn the following:

In this example, we have two API calls, one with a DocumentDate of 8/10/2017 and another with a DocumentDate of 8/11/2017. You'll notice, the results of these API calls are different. Specifically, the range of the Effective and End Dates of the second API result fall in between the Effective and End Dates of the first.

If a transaction occurred on or before 8/10/2017, the first response would be applicable because it falls outside of the date range for the SalesTax Holiday Content.

The Tax Content API only supports a single DocumentDate per API call, but users are able to call the API with a post-dated DocumentDate to retrieve content that will be effective in the future.
