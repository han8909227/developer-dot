## Summary

The key or name already exists.

## Example

```json
{
  "code": "DuplicateEntry",
  "target": "Unknown",
  "details": [
    {
      "code": "DuplicateEntry",
      "number": 193,
      "message": "The object is a duplicate of an existing object.",
      "description": "The object that you are trying to create already exists. Each -0- object must have a unique identity. The identity of a -0- is determined by the fields: -1-.",
      "faultCode": "Client",
      "helpLink": "http://developer.avalara.com/avatax/errors/DuplicateEntry",
      "severity": "Error"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Explanation

Objects must be uniquely named and identified. In most cases, two objects cannot have the same code or name. Please check your object, ensure the name and code are unique, and try your API call again.
